# LeviSprite PRO
###### only works on my computer

I made this as a continuation of previous efforts to make a pixel art editor in processing.js, (now I've switched to p5.js). It is horribly custom and probably only works for making sprites in a bespoke format that i'm figuring out as we speak

_please note: some features aren't added. if by some miracle you run the webpage, keep the console open in case it tells you something doesn't work :)_
